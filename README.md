# Username Validation Program (Python)

This is a simple Python program that validates a username based on basic rules.  
It helps beginners understand conditional statements and string methods in Python.

## Validation Rules
The username must follow these conditions:
1. Must not be more than 12 characters.
2. Must not contain spaces.
3. Must contain only alphabetic characters (no digits or special characters).

## Concepts Used
- User input
- String methods (`len()`, `isalpha()`)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Basic validation logic

## How It Works
The program takes a username as input and checks it against the rules.  
If any rule is violated, an appropriate error message is displayed.  
If all conditions are satisfied, the user is greeted.


## How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Save the file as `username_validation.py`
3. Run the program using:
   python username_validation.py
